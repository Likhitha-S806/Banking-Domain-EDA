**Banking Domain EDA:**

📌 Project Summary:
This project is an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the Banking Domain, aimed at uncovering key insights on loan disbursements and deposit patterns across diverse demographic and financial segments. Using a combination of Python, MySQL, Excel, and Power BI, the project demonstrates how raw banking data can be transformed into actionable business intelligence for strategic decision-making.

🎯 Objective:
To analyze and understand how different customer attributes—such as income band, gender, nationality, years of relationship, and banking type—**influence loan approvals and deposit behaviors in a financial institution.**

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

**Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and analysis

**MySQL** for data querying and manipulation

**Excel** for initial data inspection

**Power BI** for interactive dashboard creation

🧠 Key Features & Contributions

1. Established a seamless connection between MySQL and Python to extract and manipulate banking data efficiently
2. Automated 90% of data preprocessing tasks using Pandas and SQL queries
3. Conducted in-depth univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover key customer trends
